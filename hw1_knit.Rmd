This is the first homework of P8105.

## Problem 1

The following code chunk creates the data frame as required. 
```{r create_uniform_distribution}
set.seed(100)
dataframe = tibble(
  sample = runif(10, min = 0, max = 5),
  morethan2 = c(sample[1:10] > 2)
)
```

## Problem 2

The following code chunk creates the data frame as required.
```{r}
norm_distri = tibble(
  x = rnorm(1000),
  y = rnorm(1000),
  x_plus_y_more_than0 = c(x[1:1000] + y[1:1000] > 0 )
)
norm_distri$x_plus_y_more_than0
```
